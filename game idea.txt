Clicker/Civilization game:
You start buy clicking until you can start building tents,
You can buy worker slots, but you can only spawn in a worker if you have
a living space for them, so for 1 tent, you can house 2 workers,

You start off by specifying spaces for the villagers to live,
they can mine coal, wood, and you'll eventually will be able to
upgrade your villagers by upgrading their living spaces to start proccessing lumber, which then can be sold for rubles(money),
Once your villagers can start proccessing lumber, you can start making money to then upgrade your villagers to tents with campfires, to then
huts with campfires, which will make them more efficiant at everything they do.
